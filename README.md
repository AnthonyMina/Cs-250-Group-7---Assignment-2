System Description:

The Mountain Lion Detection System uses noise detection sensors throughout the San Diego County Parks and Recreation Department placed within a 5 square miles area. The device detects various animal noises and sends alert messages to the control computer located in the park ranger station. Alert messages contain the strength of the noise, the type of animal detected and location to within 3 miles. The alert message triggers an alarm that will sound in the park ranger station until a park ranger responds to the alert and the alarm will not sound again until another, separate noise is detected in another location. Rangers will be able to classify an alert as definite, suspected, or false, indicating the probability that a real mountain lion was detected. The control computer will save all mountain lion alerts received within 30 days and a summary of alert messages for data older than 30 days but received within the year. Rangers will be able to request reports showing all mountain lion detections by date detected and classification or by specific location of sensor; geographical report showing detection on a map of the park and 2 miles outside of the park; classification report by ranger.
